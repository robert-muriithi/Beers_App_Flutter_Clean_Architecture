  "description": "Citrus fruit. Lots of citrus fruit. Think blood orange, orange zest and grapefruit, tangerine and lemon; the fruit is balanced by floral notes in the most classic of new wave IPA hops. Amarillo adds a zesty, pithy character that sits beautifully alongside hints of toffee and honeycomb.",
